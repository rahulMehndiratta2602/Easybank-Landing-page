## My process

### Built with
HTML,SCSS(CSS with superpowers),JavaScript and DOM.

### What I learned

Before this project I had no knowledge of scss.I always used css to build web pages.I wonder if I am ever going to use css again.

### Continued development

I will be focussing on adding functionality to this website using NodeJS and ExpressJs and database conectivity using MongoDB.


### Useful resources
